    <h2>My Favorite Movie: Kaithi (2019)</h2>
    
    <p>
        <b>Kaithi</b> is one of my favorite action-thriller movies, starring <b>Karthi</b>.
        Directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, this film is a gripping story about a former prisoner
        who is forced to take on a dangerous mission overnight to save police officers from a drug mafia.
